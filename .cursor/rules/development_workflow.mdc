# Development Workflow Guidelines

When implementing the development plan detailed in `[docs/documents/version_2.md](mdc:docs/documents/version_2.md)`:

1.  **Adhere to the Plan:** Implement the features and changes outlined in the development plan on a step-by-step basis.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing:** For every implemented feature or code modification, create or update corresponding unit tests. Ensure these tests cover various scenarios to guarantee the correctness and robustness of the code.
3.  **Core Logic Verification:** If you modify any part of the core encoding or decoding logic (primarily within `src/core/`), you **must** perform the following:
    *   Update `[src/main.py](mdc:src/main.py)` to include test cases that specifically exercise the new or modified logic.
    *   Execute `[src/main.py](mdc:src/main.py)` using the command: `py -3.11 src/main.py`.
    *   Carefully examine the console output produced by `[src/main.py](mdc:src/main.py)` to verify that the encoding and decoding processes are successful and the results are as expected.
4.  **Execution Command:** When running Python scripts, particularly for testing as described above, use the command `py -3.11 <script_name.py>`.

This rule will help ensure a structured and test-driven development approach as we proceed with the V2 implementation.
